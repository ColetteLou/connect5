Instructions

This application was created using node.js,socket.io and express.

To run this app you must have node.js and npm installed locally.

Once these are installed open a command line and navigate to the connect5
folder then type node gameServer to start the server.

Once the server has started it will show listening on port 8080.

Open a browser and navigate to localhost:8080 to start the game.

I used jest to test the game logic the scripts, jest test classes are included for both the client and the server side js.

Some code will need to be uncommented out if you wish to run the tests, the lines
 are highlighted at lines 20-23, 60 and 86-90 in the client.js file which can be found in
 the client folder.

To run the tests type npm test at either the connect5 directory or in the client folder.

I could not find and efficient way to test the websocket emits and in retrospect I
would have created this application using much different technologies to showcase
my knowledge of unit testing.

I apologise that I did not fulfil the brief in it's entirety.
